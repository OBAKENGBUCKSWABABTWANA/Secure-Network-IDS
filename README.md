# üîí Secure Network & IDS Virtual Lab

The **Secure Network & IDS Virtual Lab** is a simulated cybersecurity environment that demonstrates various network threats and defensive measures. This virtual lab includes simulations for DDoS attacks and ARP spoofing within a robust mesh network topology. It features an internal DNS setup, comprehensive traffic logging, and a real-time intrusion detection system (IDS) using industry-standard tools like Wireshark and Snort.

## üìå Overview

In today's networked world, understanding and mitigating cybersecurity threats is critical. This project sets up a controlled virtual lab where:

* **Simulated Cyber Threats**: You can observe the behavior of attacks such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and ARP spoofing.
* **Mesh Network Topology**: A complex network design that mimics real-world environments with redundant paths and interconnected nodes.
* **Internal DNS**: Provides name resolution within the lab while isolating external influences.
* **Traffic Logging**: Captures network data to analyze attack signatures and patterns.
* **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Utilizes Wireshark for packet capture and Snort for real-time threat detection, offering hands-on insights into network security monitoring.

## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Operating System:** Linux is recommended.
* **Virtualization Software:** GNS3, VirtualBox, or similar for setting up a virtual lab.
* **Networking Tools:** Wireshark, Snort, internal DNS server (e.g., BIND or dnsmasq).
* **Basic Knowledge:** Familiarity with Linux networking, packet analysis, and IDS configuration.

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-network-ids-lab.git
   cd secure-network-ids-lab
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   * **For Packet Capture & Analysis:**
     Install Wireshark:

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install wireshark
     ```
   * **For Intrusion Detection:**
     Install Snort:

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install snort
     ```
   * **Internal DNS Setup:**
     Install and configure BIND or dnsmasq as per your network requirements.

3. **Setup Virtual Lab Environment**

   * Use GNS3 or VirtualBox to create a network topology that follows a mesh design. Configure multiple virtual nodes and ensure the internal DNS services are accessible to the network.
   * Configure logging by setting up syslog or custom logging scripts in `/var/log/` to store network traffic data for further analysis.

4. **Configure Snort**

   * Customize Snort configuration files (usually found in `/etc/snort/`) with rules that monitor for DDoS patterns and ARP spoofing signatures.
   * Launch Snort in IDS mode:

     ```bash
     sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i <interface>
     ```

5. **Running Simulations**

   * **DDoS Simulation:**
     Use custom scripts or network tools (e.g., hping3) to generate high volumes of traffic:

     ```bash
     hping3 --flood -p 80 <target_ip>
     ```
   * **ARP Spoofing Simulation:**
     Use tools like `arpspoof` to simulate ARP poisoning:

     ```bash
     sudo arpspoof -i <interface> -t <target_ip> <gateway_ip>
     ```

6. **Monitoring & Analysis**

   * Launch Wireshark to inspect live traffic on the network interface.
   * Check Snort alerts to verify that the IDS is detecting the simulated threat events.
